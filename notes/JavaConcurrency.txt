MultiThreading problems:

1.safety hazard
once you solve the safety hazard you run into the problem of
2.Liveness hazard : here a thread of execution give the feeling of being dead, just like a single threaded
    program can do the same by never coming out of an infinte loop, a multithreaded program can do the same
    thing by going for a lock and never coming back, these are called liveness hazards.
    there are three types of liveness problems.
    *Deadlock
    *starvation
    *livelock
3. Performance
   Threads are all about resource sharing. and once a resource doesnt get shared efficiently you run into
   all kinds of resource sharing problems.


Thread safety:
    Atomicity:
    race conditions:

    few of the things that you already know about:


Sharing Objects:




the Java memory Model
* the java memory model defines a relationship (partial-ordering) called happens before.
* For changes made by a Thread B to be visible to thread A. there must be a clear Happens-before relation between them
* in the absence of this happens before relationship the JVM is free to reorder everything in its best wisdom.
* Rules of happens before:
    $$: Program order rule (PO):
        each line in the program order happens before every line following it in that program
    $$: Monitor Lock rule (ML):
        a monitor unlock happens before every other monitor lock
    $$: Volatile variable rule(V):
        a write to volatile variable happnes before everyread to the variable
    $$ Thread start rule(T):
        a call to thread start happens before every statement in the same thread.
    $$ Thread Termination rule(Terminator):
        every action in a thread happens before any thread can find out about its termination. either
        throught thread.join or through isAlive() method.
    $$ Thread interruption(I):
        if a thread attemps to interrupt some thread. then call to thread.interrupt() happens before any actio
        in the thread that it is trying to interrupt.
    $$ Finalization and trasitivity(Fity):
        constructor happens before finalization.
        if a happens before b and b happens before c then A happnes before C
    Fity interrupted the terminator, the start the motor vehicle and PO

    finalization and transitivy, thread interrruption and termination. thread start rule ,monitor lock, volatile.
