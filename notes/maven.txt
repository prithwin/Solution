maven uses conventions to easily create a build job
built in phases of maven
-clean
-default
-site
each of these built in lifecycles has some predifined phases.
for example the one called default has the folllowing phases:
-validate: it validates all the modules and all the dependencies
-compile: compiles java files
-test runs all the junit test.
-package
-install
-deploy

each build phase is mapped to a particular execution in a plugin. so what ever works out of the box is working because
they are all predefined by maven in some way or the other.
