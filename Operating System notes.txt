    BASIC COMPUTER ORGANIZATION:
    - CPU is connected to a whole bunch of device controllers that provide access to shared memory(RAM controller itself)
    is just one such controller.
    - all of the controller compete for shared memory, the memory contoller synchronizes access to these shared Resources.
    - for a computer to start running the bootstrap program has to be run. the boostrap process is Stored in The EEProm
    of the devices.its loaded by the bios of that particular hardware.
    -as soon as the operating system is loaded it calls the init() method and waits for various events to occur.
    -any event that happens i called an interrupt from hardware or software.
    -all interrupt have a certain service routines, as soon as the CPU is interrupted It'll transfer to the interrupt
    service Routine
